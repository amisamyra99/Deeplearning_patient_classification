## Data Set Information: 

The dataset is Electronic Health Record Predicting collected from a private Hospital in
Indonesia. It contains the patients laboratory test results used to determine next patient
treatment whether in care or out care patient. The task embedded to the dataset is
classification prediction.
Attribute Information:
Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The
number of rings is the value to predict: either as a continuous value or as a classification
problem.
